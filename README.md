# sql2++
A type-safe C++ ORM wrapper for SQLite3 (and possibly other SQL engines) 
## Quick Reference
### Type definition
sql2++ operates with the database by binding C++ user types with the table definitions in the sqlite database. It makes so by facilitating template function describe(). Let's consider a user type User:

    struct user
    {
	    int id;
	    std::string first_name;
	    std::string last_name;
	    std::string email;
    };
    
Let's describe this type, so that sql2++ would know how to write, update, read and remove users:

    template <typename VisitorT>
	void describe(VisitorT &visitor, user *)
	{
		visitor("Users"); // Table name: Users
		visitor(sql2xx::identity, &user::id, "ID"); // Idenitity column 'ID'
		visitor(&user::first_name, "FirstName"); // First name will be stored in column 'FirstName'
		visitor(&user::last_name, "LastName"); // etc.
		visitor(&user::email, "email");
	}
### Table creation
This will bind objects of type 'user' with the records in table 'Users' , with an autogenerated id. To make sql2xx create this table we only need to write:

    sql2xx::transaction tx(connection);
	
	tx.create_table<user>();
	tx.commit();

### Insertion (INSERT statement)
Now to insert a new record we can use an inserter. Please note, the inserter can be reused -- this way you'll save time by avoiding the creation of an underlying statement:

	user users[] = {
		{	0, "John", "Doe", "jdoe@gmail.com"	},
		{	0, "Bob", "Dylan", "dylan@hotmail.com"	},
		{	0, "Ian", "Burr", "iburr@yahoo.com"	},
		{	0, "Bill", "Burr", "william.burr@gmail.com"	},
	};
	auto inserter = tx.insert<user>();
	
	for (auto u = std::begin(users); u != std::end(users); ++u)
		inserter(*u);
	tx.commit();
		
Upon execution of this code you'll end up with a Users table populated with the four user records. Please note, that every entry in the 'users' array will be assigned an autogenerated id equal to that in the ID column of the Users table. Hence, the inserter needs a non-constant reference to the object being inserted.
	
### Reading (SELECT statement)
The simplest form of reading is unconditional (no WHERE clause is used). To do this we first need to create a reader:

	auto users_reader = tx.select<user>();

The 'users_reader' object is a functor object, that populates an object passed in with fields read from the database, if there're any and moves the read pointer to the next record. If no read has been done, the functor object returns 'false':

	vector<user> records;
	
	for (user record; users_reader(record); )
		records.push_back(record);

And as simple as that you'll have records vector populated with all the records in the 'Users' table.
A more complex form of reading is when a condition is involved. A condition is a C++ expression that allows you to bind C++ variables with the parameters in the query. Like this:

	std::string last_name_filter = "Burr";
	vector<user> records;
	auto filtered_users_reader = tx.select<user>(sql2xx::c(&user::last_name) == sql2xx::p(last_name_filter));
	
	for (user record; filtered_users_reader(record); )
		records.push_back(record);

Now, if no other writes to Users occurred since the insertion operation above, the records will be populated with two users with the last name "Burr".
